## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the local JS data in the script.js file to dynamically populate the content

### What I learned

I was able to refresh my knowledge (after a long time ðŸ˜…) on JavaScript DOM, CSS Selector and CSS Layout

I realized that for the below code snippet to work, the elements needs to be elements of the same parent

```html
 <div class="summary__rating"><span class="summary__quality"><img src="" alt="Memory Icon">
            <span class="props"><!--Fetched by JS--></span></span><span><span class="score"><!--Fetched by JS--></span>
            <span class="ovr">/ 100</span></span></div>
        <div class="summary__rating"><span class="summary__quality">
            <img src="assets/images/icon-verbal.svg" alt="Verbal Icon">
            <span class="props"><!--Fetched by JS--></span></span><span><span class="score"></span><!--Fetched by JS-->
            <span class="ovr">/ 100</span></span></div>
        <div class="summary__rating"><span class="summary__quality">
            <img src="assets/images/icon-visual.svg" alt="Visual Icon">
            <span class="props"><!--Fetched by JS--></span> </span><span><span class="score"></span><!--Fetched by JS-->
            <span class="ovr">/ 100</span></span></div>
```
```css
.props:nth-of-type(n) {}
```
Also, I'm proud of my JS code ðŸ˜…ðŸŽ‰. Never belived that I could still remember JS

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I want to still work on the layout aspect of the site and remove excess spacings
